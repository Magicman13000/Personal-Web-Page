        Hello! My name is David Ruhlman. I am a senior at Pittsburg State
        University studying CIS. My hobbies are building computers and playing
        games. As of recently I started running a minecraft server so all of my
        free time goes to making the game better for the people playing on the
        server. I have a friend that is walking me through making plugins for
        Minecraft. There's a lot of interesting aspects to running a server that
        has fascinated me.
        <br />
        <br />
        I also decided to try streaming games. I have to find something that can
        keep me entertained and feel productive at the same time. It has also
        been helping me with software such as Illustrator and Premiere. Whenever
        something intrest me I become fixated on the topic.
